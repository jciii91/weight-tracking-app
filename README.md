Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
- This app is intended to be used by people trying to manage their weight. It needed to provide a way to log user measurements, set a goal weight, and show past measurements.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
- I needed to create a login page, a main screen to show the table of weights and the goal weight, and a dialog screen for accepting inputs. My designs were successful because they isolated functionality well and in a manner that was intuitive.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
- I started by designing the UI and then writing functions that accomplished singular tasks. This helped to keep my code clean and easily maintainable.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
- Android Studio provides tools to emulate different devices so I conducted user acceptance testing to ensure all proccesses were working as expected. This process caught bugs or poor design choices as I went along.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
- I had an issue with adding new rows to the table. The rows needed information from the dialog window the user entered information into, so I needed to write a helper function that gave the rows the proper context so that they could be made from the dialog but added to the table on the main screen.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
- I would say the table and its rows. I am proud of my ability to solve the problem that arose and I think I came up with a good way to add rows and bind delete buttons to them.
